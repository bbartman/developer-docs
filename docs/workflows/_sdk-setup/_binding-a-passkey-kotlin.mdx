The `bindPasskey` function expects a URL. This can either be a binding passkey link fetched directly from our public API, or a binding passkey instruction that is the result of a redirection to your web application. This function should be used in conjunction with [isBindPasskeyUrl](#bind-passkey-url-validation) in order to determine if the URL being passed in is a valid bind passkey URL.

#### Usage

```javascript
EmbeddedSdk.bindPasskey(
    url: String,
) { result ->
    result.onSuccess { }
    result.onFailure { }
}
```

Where the response type consists of an object containing a `Passkey` and an optional `postBindingRedirectUri` URL to redirect to upon succesfully binding a passkey.

```javascript
data class BindPasskeyResponse(
    val passkey: Passkey,
    val postBindingRedirectUri: String?,
)
```
