The `bindCredential` function expects a URL. This can either be a binding credential link fetched directly from our public API, or a binding credential instruction that is the result of a redirection to your web application. This function should be used in conjunction with [isBindCredentialUrl](#bind-credential-url-validation) in order to determine if the URL being passed in is a valid bind credential URL.

#### Usage

```javascript
const bindCredentialResponse = await embedded.bindCredential(url);
```

Where the response type consists of an object containing a `Credential` and an optional `postBindRedirect` URL to redirect to upon succesfully binding a credential.

```javascript
{
    credential: Credential;
    postBindRedirect?: string;
}
```
