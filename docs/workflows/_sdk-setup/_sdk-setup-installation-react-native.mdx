:::warning
Note that this library is not compatible with Expo projects. This is because Expo's “managed” workflow does not allow usage of React Native libraries that introduce their own native code beyond the React Native APIs and components that are available in the Expo client app. If you have an Expo app and wish to use this project, you must eject.
