The `bindPasskey` function expects a URL. This can either be a binding passkey link fetched directly from our public API, or a binding passkey instruction that is the result of a redirection to your web application. This function should be used in conjunction with [isBindPasskeyUrl](#bind-passkey-url-validation) in order to determine if the URL being passed in is a valid bind passkey URL.

#### Usage

```javascript
Embedded.bindPasskey(
    url: string,
): Promise<BindPasskeyResponse>
```

Where the response type consists of an object containing a `Passkey` and an optional `postBindingRedirectURI` URL to redirect to upon succesfully binding a passkey.

```javascript
interface BindPasskeyResponse {
  passkey: Passkey;
  postBindingRedirectURI?: string;
}
```
