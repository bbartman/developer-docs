The `authenticate` function expects a `URL` and a `PasskeyID`. The Beyond Identity specific URL is generated during on OAuth2 authorization flow and carries with it a JWT that contains information specific to the current authorization request. When passing this URL into the `authenticate` function, this will perform a challenge/response against the private key bound to the passkey on your device. This function should be used in conjunction with [isAuthenticateUrl](#authenticate-url-validation) in order to determine if the URL being passed in is a valid authenticate URL.

Before calling this function you will need to ask the user to select a passkey that has been bound to the device. A selection view can be built in conjunction with [getPasskeys](#listing-passkeys).

#### Usage

```dart
await Embeddedsdk.authenticate(
    String url,
    String passkeyId,
)
```

Where the response consists of an object containing a `redirectUrl` that you should redirect back to in order to complete the authentication flow, and an optional `message` to display to the user.

```dart
class AuthenticateResponse(
    String redirectUrl,
    String message,
)
```
