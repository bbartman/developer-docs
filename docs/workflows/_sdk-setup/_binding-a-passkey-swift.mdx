The `bindCredential` function expects a URL. This can either be a binding credential link fetched directly from our public API, or a binding credential instruction that is the result of a redirection to your web application. This function should be used in conjunction with [isBindCredentialUrl](#bind-credential-url-validation) in order to determine if the URL being passed in is a valid bind credential URL.

#### Usage

```javascript
Embedded.shared.bindCredential(
    url: URL,
    callback: @escaping(Result<BindCredentialResponse, BISDKError>) -> Void
)
```

Where the response type consists of an object containing a `Credential` and an optional `postBindingRedirectURI` URL to redirect to upon succesfully binding a credential.

```javascript
struct BindCredentialResponse: Codable, Equatable {
    let credential: Credential
    let postBindingRedirectURI: URL?
}
```
