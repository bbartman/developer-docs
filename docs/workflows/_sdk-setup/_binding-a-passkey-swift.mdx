The `bindPasskey` function expects a URL. This can either be a binding passkey link fetched directly from our public API, or a binding passkey instruction that is the result of a redirection to your web application. This function should be used in conjunction with [isBindPasskeyUrl](#bind-passkey-url-validation) in order to determine if the URL being passed in is a valid bind passkey URL.

#### Usage

```swift
Embedded.shared.bindPasskey(
    url: URL,
    callback: @escaping(Result<BindPasskeyResponse, BISDKError>) -> Void
)
```

Where the response type consists of an object containing a `Passkey` and an optional `postBindingRedirectURI` URL to redirect to upon succesfully binding a passkey.

```swift
struct BindPasskeyResponse: Codable, Equatable {
    let passkey: Passkey
    let postBindingRedirectURI: URL?
}
```
