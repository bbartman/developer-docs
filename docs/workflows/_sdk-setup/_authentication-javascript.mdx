```javascript
const authenticateResponse = await embedded.authenticate(url, passkeyID);
```

Where the response consists of an object containing a `redirectURL` that you should redirect back to in order to complete the authentication flow, and an optional `message` to display to the user.

```javascript
{
    redirectURL: string;
    message?: string;
}
```
