The Embedded SDK is a holistic SDK solution offering the entire experience embedded in your product. Users will not need to download the Beyond Identity Authenticator. A set of functions are provided to you through the `Embedded` namespace. This SDK supports OIDC and OAuth2.

## URL Validation

### Bind Credential URL Validation

This function is used to validate if a given URL is able to be used by the `bindCredential` function.

```javascript
if (Embedded.shared.isBindCredentialUrl(url)) {
    // bind the credential using `bindCredential`
}
```

### Authenticate URL Validation

This function is used to validate if a given URL is able to be used by the `authenticate` function.

```javascript
if (Embedded.shared.isAuthenticateUrl(url)) {
    // authenticate against a credential bound to the device
}
```

## Credential Management

### Listing Credentials

The `getCredentials` function enables you to get all credentials currently bound to the device.

```javascript
Embedded.shared.getCredentials(
    callback: @escaping (Result<[Credential], BISDKError>) -> Void
)
```

Where the response is a `[Credential]`.

### Deleting a Credential

The `deleteCredential` function allows you to delete a credential given its ID.

```javascript
Embedded.shared.deleteCredential(
    for id: CredentialID,
    callback: @escaping (Result<(), BISDKError>) -> Void
)
```
