### Bind Credential URL Validation

This function is used to validate if a given URL is able to be used by the `bindCredential` function.

```javascript
if (embedded.isBindCredentialUrl(url)) {
    // bind the credential using `bindCredential`
}
```

### Authenticate URL Validation

This function is used to validate if a given URL is able to be used by the `authenticate` function.

```javascript
if (embedded.isAuthenticateUrl(url)) {
    // authenticate against a credential bound to the device
}
```

## Credential Management

### Listing Credentials

The `getCredentials` function enables you to get all credentials currently bound to the device.

```javascript
const allCredentials = await embedded.getCredentials();
```

Where the response is a `[Credential]`.

### Deleting a Credential

The `deleteCredential` function allows you to delete a credential given its ID.

```javascript
await embedded.deleteCredential(credential.id);
```
