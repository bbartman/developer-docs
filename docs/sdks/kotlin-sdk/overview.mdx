The Embedded SDK is a holistic SDK solution offering the entire experience embedded in your product. Users will not need to download the Beyond Identity Authenticator. A set of functions are provided to you through the `Embedded` namespace. This SDK supports OIDC and OAuth2.

## Binding a Credential

## Authentication

The `authenticate` function expects a `URL` and a `CredentialID`. The Beyond Identity specific URL is generated during the OAuth2 authorization flow and carries with it a JWT that contains information specific to the current authorization request. When passing this URL into the `authenticate` function, this will perform a challenge/response against the private key bound to the credential on your device. This function should be used in conjunction with [isAuthenticateUrl](#authenticate-url-validation) in order to determine if the URL being passed in is a valid authenticate URL.

Before calling this function you will need to ask the user to select a credential that has been bound to the device. A selection view can be built in conjunction with [getCredentials](#listing-credentials).

#### Usage

```javascript
EmbeddedSdk.authenticate(
    url: String,
    credentialId: CredentialID,
) { result ->
    result.onSuccess { }
    result.onFailure { }
}
```

Where the response consists of an object containing a `redirectUrl` that you should redirect back to in order to complete the authentication flow, and an optional `message` to display to the user.

```javascript
data class AuthenticateResponse(
    val redirectUrl: String?,
    val message: String?,
)
```

## URL Validation

### Bind Credential URL Validation

This function is used to validate if a given URL is able to be used by the `bindCredential` function.

```javascript
if (EmbeddedSdk.isBindCredentialUrl(url)) {
    // bind the credential using `bindCredential`
}
```

### Authenticate URL Validation

This function is used to validate if a given URL is able to be used by the `authenticate` function.

```javascript
if (EmbeddedSdk.isAuthenticateUrl(url)) {
    // authenticate against a credential bound to the device
}
```

## Credential Management

### Listing Credentials

The `getCredentials` function enables you to get all credentials currently bound to the device.

```javascript
EmbeddedSdk.getCredentials() { result ->
    result.onSuccess { }
    result.onFailure { }
}
```

Where the response is a `List<Credential>`.

### Deleting a Credential

The `deleteCredential` function allows you to delete a credential given its ID.

```javascript
EmbeddedSdk.deleteCredential(
    id: String,
) { result ->
    result.onSuccess { }
    result.onFailure { }
}
```
